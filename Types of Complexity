Types of Complexity 
There are two types of complexities i.e. Time and Space Complexity


Time Complexity 
So what is complexity ? Let's first understand in simple world time taken by algorithm according to input is time complexity.
Let's go deep into it It's relationship between functions that gives how time grows as input grows.


Types of cases
1)Worst Case
2)Best Case
3)Worst Case

What is worst case ?
Worst case is case in which algorithm takes worst input so it gives worst time taken by algorithm.We mainly use worst case to calculate the complexity of algorithms.

What is best case ?
